Just saw Raid 2... my head’s spinning like it’s caught in a blender, scenes flashing through my mind like a kaleidoscope. My back is killing me from those theater seats. Why don’t they make 'em ergonomic? Anyway, the noise was like a tornado of chaos, and I swear I’m wearing more popcorn than I ate. Kernels everywhere. 

> The fighting, it’s like... a ballet? But with sledgehammers and blood, like if a watermelon festival went very, very wrong. Who knew bones could sound like that? It’s like the soundtrack was made of exploding bubble wrap, but with more agony. I kept thinking “𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ” so I can pause and just... breathe, you know?

There was this car chase, or was it a prison riot? They kind of blend together like a smoothie made from fists and broken glass. My ears are still ringing, but it’s like a trance. Some guy spilled his drink near the end and the smell—jeez, smells are like knives in that close theater air. That Hammer Girl. What a wild, wacky Alice in a Wonderland of violence, like if Tim Burton had a really bad day.

Vibrating muscles, twitching like a drummer on caffeine overdose. Can you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   on mute and still feel it? Probably, it’s all so visceral—every broken bone a minor chord in some brutal symphony.

Was it a death scene or a dance-off? I can’t even keep them straight anymore. I need to sit on a cloud and nap, or maybe just lie flat on a quiet sidewalk and count stars.

    float chaos = NULL;
